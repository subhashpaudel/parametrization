This Fortran90 code calculates the volume of the sphere with user defined explicit and implicit radius. For example 1.)  if user inputs radius explicitly volume routine gives volume. 2.) if user inputs surface area then the radius routine calculates the radius and volume routine gives the volume. 3.) If user inputs tangent plane and the center radius routine calculates radius from these information and volume routine gives radius. User can write as many different functions as they want according to what they want to achieve and under what conditions.
